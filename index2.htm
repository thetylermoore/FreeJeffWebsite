          ya'll, This be David updating this har free jeff site, as many of you
          know we are putting the finishing touches on our wonderfully demotastic
          demo entitled, &quot;Son, My Demo&quot;, it will feature four (soon to be) classic
          songs, Free Jeff Show, Pogs and Troll Dolls, Putting the Love Back
          in Lovecraft, and 360 Days (Until It's Spring Again). As many of you
          know our bass player alex left us for hippie country, we have found
          a replacement and should begin practicing again soon. If you are interested
          in recieving a copy of said demo please feel free to email us with
          you adress and we can send you a copy in the mail, if you live in another
          country of something please don't do this we are a really poor band
          and don't want to pay that much in postage, hopefully if we have shows
          in the future we should have copies to give to all the kids. So until
          next time remember, Elvis didn't die on a crapper somewhere, he went
          out fighting a mummy with a black JFK to protect the rest home he loves
          so dearly (www.bubbahotep.com)</font> </p>

          all. it is rumored that an intruder from century 21.1 invaded and mad
          haxx0red up this site. we're not sure what the message meant exactly,
          but it was highly encrypted and we hired a crack-pot team of monkeys
          to decipher it. most of what we understood was posted below sans the
          last line, &quot;WE AM SASSLESS.&quot; fah-rumph. in other news, the completion
          of the &quot;SON, MY DEMO,&quot; is still being pursued. minor hurdles
          have surfaced, including the departure of our most treasured horn player-extraordinaire,
          Mr. S. Ramsey. the future of the horn tracks is not 100% certain, but
          doug will make an attempt to fill in. all of the rythm section parts
          have been finished, and we are anxiously waiting for horns and vocals.
          wooh. the majority of free jeff will be going on vacation from the
          hours
          of july 11-18...5/6 to be exact. (guess who won't be there and i'll
          give you a package of stale animal crackers!) we were offered two gigs
          in the past month, but were unfortunately forced to decline because
          of the prior commitments of a few key members. we're trying folks,
          i promise. ah i rant too much for my own good. thuh thuh thuh that's
          all foks (tell me where that reference is from and i'll award you with
          2! stale animal crackers packages!). peace.</font></p>

          the isolation booth), maybe one day, maybe one day...... We still hate

          and kind of rambling, hey guess what, we might have another message
          bored soon, wont that be killer cool like my name was Tito Jackson,
          WOW, Tito, oh yeah and you should all e-mail us because we are sad
          and lonely because no one loves us enough to send us a message telling
          us indepth about their truthful and undying love for us, our music
          and our herds of cattle, Doug actually has the most cattle out of anyone
          in the band, he has 19 cows, 5 bulls and a little baby named Cornelius,
          he loves that cow more than life itself, even though the cow has never
          sent us an e-mail to say it loves us too, oh how our hearts break at
          the mere idea of an unloving cow, my heart bleeds like i was a liberal
          at the thought of unlove, it's the inti-love you know, like the anti-dance,
          which only lead to the idea of dancing at free jeff shows, there should
          be more, SKANK CON FLAB YOU ALL, we are going to have more intro pages
          soon on the website, and someday maybe will all live in peace and harmony
          with all the bees in the trees and all the skunks that go clunk, MY
          MY MY, antwan and are having way to much fun setting this stuff up,
          and seeing as how i know for a fact that you all are having a horrible
          time in your depressing and pathetic everyday lives i will leave you
